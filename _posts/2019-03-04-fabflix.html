    <p> This project is an embodiment of a learning process. It is meant to mimick a widely-known video streaming platform to deeper study the design and develop- ment for a full-stack website, alongside with the features that are able to maximize user experience. </p>

    <p> Over the span of 10 weeks, a multitude of layers were built upon what began as a raw sketch of a site used to simply browse and transact movies. Deployed via Amazaon Web Services (AWS), the project first explores real-world techniques that are used to ensure application security. These would include securing the site by adding HTTPS and improving the user-authentication process by adding reCAPTCHA to customer login module.

    <p> communicate with the database whenever there is a need to obtain any metadata or to delete/update records. All of the database functions are extended to further improve the GUI by implementing a powerful search box that can search on multiple attributes and support autocomplete, and also to build an employee dashboard that is accessible for any authorized user with valid credentials to modify the movie database. Just like that, the essential frameworks were laid out and the website was up and running. 
    </p>
    
    <p> Although not the focal point of the project, a coherent and user-friendly UI/UX design was kept in mind throughout the entire development process. The website took a more minimalistic and modern approach to its general layout, with the intention to streamline productivity and navigation across its different pages. Apache JMeter was set up additionally to measure the performance of the site's features. As it had transitioned a fully functional web-based platform, the project wraps up with plans to extend the front-end technology to Android devices.
